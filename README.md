# pixelPaint.js
# An in-browser 'pixel art' style painting app written in pure Vanilla JS. It uses an HTML <table> element as a canvas and supports color choice through adjusting RGB values, brush opacity, brush size, a pallete of recently used colors, and undo/redo functions. Paintings are also represented as a three-dimensional array, which can be saved as JSON strings and loaded later in the browsing session (there are no user controls for this at the moment, as I mainly added this function to support planned 'gallery uploads' using PHP and a MySQL database).
